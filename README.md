# Abby's Github Website
Helo, this is my first Github website curated for my assignment. I will be using this website to further my understanding in my Computer Science Principles class at Metropolitan State University of Denver.
I created this README file originally, thinking that I would have to code in html instead of just this. But after I remembered some coding basics in html, I realized I am able to just type in here.
I am excited to see how I advance this website. :D
